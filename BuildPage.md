### Quick instructions for Linux ###
  1. type 'make' and enjoy

### See eRampage ###
Building eRampage is very similar to building Eduke32. Because of this, I advise you to read Eduke32 wiki about building executables under [Windows](http://wiki.eduke32.com/wiki/Building_EDuke32_on_Windows) and [Linux](http://wiki.eduke32.com/wiki/Building_EDuke32_on_Linux). Please note the differences:

  * Mapster32 won't compile in eRampage installation. This is not a build problem.
  * Paths to game files under Linux have been changed, so they won't interfere with Eduke32
