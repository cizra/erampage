Here's what you need to download:

# Binary files #

This [package](http://www.jonhunt.com/redneck/erampage.html) contains Windows binaries, as well as some resources needed for the game. This is the only file required for Windows users. Un-pack it and proceed with [installing game files](InstallPage.md). If you can't open the package, download [7-Zip archiver](http://www.7-zip.org/).

Linux users will also need this file, as it contains resources needed for the game. (TODO: we really should do something so that the Linux users wouldn't have to download Windwoes binaries)


# Source code #

Linux users are required to download the sources to build the game. Windows users may also download the sources and build the binary executable themselves if they want to.

In order do download the sources, go to the [Source page](http://code.google.com/p/erampage/source/checkout) and follow the instructions there. Windows users may need to install [SVN client](http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads) before they could download the sources.

Note that erampage and its ancestors (eduke32 and the Build engine) are licensed with GPL, which means that you have the right to examine, modify and redistribute the engine source code, but NOT the game content. How to distinguish them? The stuff you download from the SVN repository is free, the stuff that comes from your Redneck Rampage disks is not free. TODO: figure out if erampage.7z is free or not.

# Redneck Rampage data files #

You need these files from the disk:
  1. redneck.grp
  1. tables.dat
  1. lookup.dat
